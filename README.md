Lightning fast HTTP server

This project is mostly self-educational. The main goal is to implement an asynchronous HTTP server with efficiency as the first priority.
"C" was chosen to keep it as light as possible, and to keep as little deps as possible. After all, having an own implementation of circular buffer can be handy in the future.

The code should compile on every Unix with C99 compatible GCC/clang compiler and C standard library. Please drop me a line in the DM in case of any error.
